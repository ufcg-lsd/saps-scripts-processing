# saps-scripts-processing

This repository keeps the source code for the SAPS processing implementations mantained by the Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG).

Each implementations is mantained in a separated branch of this repository. We have the following implementations:

1. [`ufcg-sebal`](https://github.com/ufcg-lsd/saps-scripts-processing/tree/ufcg-sebal) - This is the reference SEBAL implementation developed by UFCG. It uses the metereological information and elevation data produced by the [`usgsapis`](https://github.com/ufcg-lsd/saps-scripts-inputdownload/tree/googleapis) or the [`googleapis`](https://github.com/ufcg-lsd/saps-scripts-inputdownload/tree/googleapis) inputdownloading implementations, and the following products generated by the [`default`](https://github.com/ufcg-lsd/saps-scripts-preprocessing/tree/default) preprocessing implementation: albedo, Rn, Ts, NDVI. It produces as output the evaporative fraction (EF) and the daily evapotranspiration (ET24h).
1. [`sebkc-sebal`](https://github.com/ufcg-lsd/saps-scripts-processing/tree/sebkc-sebal) - This implementation is a port of the  SEBAL model available in the [sebkc R package](https://rdrr.io/github/gowusu/sebkc/). It uses the metereological information and elevation data produced by the [`usgsapis`](https://github.com/ufcg-lsd/saps-scripts-inputdownload/tree/googleapis) or the [`googleapis`](https://github.com/ufcg-lsd/saps-scripts-inputdownload/tree/googleapis) inputdownloading implementations, and the following products generated by the [`default`](https://github.com/ufcg-lsd/saps-scripts-preprocessing/tree/default) preprocessing implementation: albedo, Ts, NDVI, LAI, and SAVI. It produces the outputs generated by `ufcg-sebal` implementation.
1. [`sebkc-tseb`](https://github.com/ufcg-lsd/saps-scripts-processing/tree/sebkc-tseb) - This implementation is a port of the  Two Source Surface Energy Balance (TSEB-PT) model available in the [sebkc R package](https://rdrr.io/github/gowusu/sebkc/). It uses the metereological information and elevation data produced by the [`usgsapis`](https://github.com/ufcg-lsd/saps-scripts-inputdownload/tree/googleapis) or the [`googleapis`](https://github.com/ufcg-lsd/saps-scripts-inputdownload/tree/googleapis) inputdownloading implementations, and the following products generated by the [`default`](https://github.com/ufcg-lsd/saps-scripts-preprocessing/tree/default) preprocessing implementation: albedo, Ts, NDVI, LAI, and SAVI. It produces the outputs generated by `ufcg-sebal` implementation.
