# saps-scripts-processing

This is the reference SEBAL implementation developed by UFCG. It uses the metereological information and elevation data produced by the [`usgsapis`](https://github.com/ufcg-lsd/saps-scripts-inputdownload/tree/googleapis) or the [`googleapis`](https://github.com/ufcg-lsd/saps-scripts-inputdownload/tree/googleapis) inputdownloading implementations, and the following products generated by the [`default`](https://github.com/ufcg-lsd/saps-scripts-preprocessing/tree/default) preprocessing implementation: albedo, Rn, Ts, NDVI. It produces as output the evaporative fraction (EF) and the daily evapotranspiration (ET24h).
