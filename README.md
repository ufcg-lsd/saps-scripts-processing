# saps-scripts-processing

This implementation is a port of the  Two Source Surface Energy Balance (TSEB-PT) model available in the [sebkc R package](https://rdrr.io/github/gowusu/sebkc/). It uses the metereological information and elevation data produced by the [`usgsapis`](https://github.com/ufcg-lsd/saps-scripts-inputdownload/tree/googleapis) or the [`googleapis`](https://github.com/ufcg-lsd/saps-scripts-inputdownload/tree/googleapis) inputdownloading implementations, and the following products generated by the [`default`](https://github.com/ufcg-lsd/saps-scripts-preprocessing/tree/default) preprocessing implementation: albedo, Ts, NDVI, LAI, and SAVI. It produces the outputs generated by `ufcg-sebal` implementation.
